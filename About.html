                  What Is That Tree That Ymir Fell Into?</h4>
                <p>
                  Quite recently, we finally saw the story of the founder of all Titans, Ymir. And while some fans might be disappointed at the lack of a grandiose journey of how she built the Titan/Eldian empire, that was always kind of the point.
Both the Marleyans and the Eldians used Ymir's story as propaganda for their goals and massively exaggerated it both positively and negatively. But, the most supernatural part of her story was the goop/tree she fell into while running away from her executioners. This liquid she fell into fused with her and seemingly turned her into the original Titan. But, what exactly is this tree? How does it give her Titan powers? Why was there just a spine floating inside it?

                <h4>
                  How Does Ymir's Titan Sculpting Work?</h4>
                <p>
                  That's right; we said that Ymir builds the Titans. One of the most horrifying monsters of all time? Made by a little girl. From this clay and/or sand, she crafts their bodies one part at a time. Time is different here, and her work could take days, months, or even years, but it only takes a second to appear in reality.
                  Quite honestly, nothing is really clear about this process yet. Do they even have to be humanoid? Are these horrifying creatures only so hideous because of Ymir's warped mind? Are Abnormals the Titans Ymir crafted when she was slacking on the job? Why is she okay creating these hideous, cannibalistic, and brainless forms to trap people in?

                <h4>Do The Memories And Traits Of All Shifters Transfer Down?</h4>
                <p>
                  So we know that Eren has a real connection to his Titan and that it allows him to glimpse at the past and future of the previous holders of the Attack Titan. But, how does this apply to the other Titans? Did the Jaw Titan Ymir ever get flashbacks of Marcel's childhood? Did she take on some of his personality traits?
                  Eren states that Armin has become more like Bertoldt, due to his growing fascination with Annie. But that easily could have been Eren lying again. We still don't know how these PATHS work for the seven other titans, and that feels weird considering how close we are to the end.

                <h4>Who Was The King Behind The Walls?</h4>
                <p>
                  And along with the Ackermans comes to Fritz family, the true Royalty within the walls. Quite honestly, we know a ton about this family. More so than most other loose threads in the story so far. But, one character in this horrible line of tyrants is the coward king.
We're talking about the King who ran to Paradis Island and locked his people and their memories behind the three great walls. It seems like it might've been the same King that Ymir and her daughters were so fervently dedicated to, but it hasn't been confirmed. And, how did this king embed the so-called "Pact" that takes away the free will of every Founding Titan?
